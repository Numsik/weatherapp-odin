This is my simple weather app built using the Visual Crossing API
.

It might not be perfect, but it gets the job done!
At the moment, I don’t plan to add more updates – but who knows? Maybe one day I’ll turn this into a million-dollar app 😄

⚠️ 
Note:
The temperature might be off by about 1–2 °C. This is due to the Visual Crossing data source, not the app itself.
